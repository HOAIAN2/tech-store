# api-sample
Hi this is HOAI AN, I just set-up a very simple express api server. If you don't want set-up a full project, just download my repo.
### Usage
* `git clone https://github.com/HOAIAN2/api-sample.git`
* `cd api-sample`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
> This is an API Server so you can build your owner Front-End web app and put it into `public` folder

> I'm learing MVC so I try to make this like a MVC API Server at much at possiable (Sorry if something kinda bad).
